The loss of Civil Discourse has been decried in a [wide](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-importance-of-civil-discourse_us_59c5782be4b08d6615504261) [range](https://www.aacu.org/publications-research/periodicals/plea-civil-discourse-needed-academys-leadership) [of](https://www.wsj.com/articles/civil-discourse-in-decline-where-does-it-end-1496071276) [publications][], and the [internet](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/readersreact/la-ol-le-civil-discourse-trump-internet-20170609-story.html) and [social media](https://www.technewsworld.com/story/85019.html) have been cited as a primarly cause of this decline. 

The **admin/b** team took this as inspiration: can internet technology, and particularly the Sitecore Experience Platform and xConnect, help lead us back to using communication to enhance understanding rather than enflame passions? Our Civil Disourse module does not seek to ban people or prevent communication; rather it engages users by reminding them of the potential negative and positive impact of the words.  When users comment using inflamatory or hurtful language, the module responds by recommendeing alternative phrasings that will have a more constructive impact. xConnect is used to persist users comments, and to track negative interactions, enabling a cool down mechanism to temporarily block submssions from users who are engaging in a high volume of potentially abusive interactions.
